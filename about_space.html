    Debates concerning the nature, essence and the mode of existence of space date
     back to antiquity; namely, to treatises like the Timaeus of Plato, or Socrates
      in his reflections on what the Greeks called khôra (i.e. "space"), or in the 
      Physics of Aristotle (Book IV, Delta) in the definition of topos (i.e. place),
       or in the later "geometrical conception of place" as "space qua extension" in
        the Discourse on Place (Qawl fi al-Makan) of the 11th-century Arab polymath
         Alhazen.[2] Many of these classical philosophical questions were discussed 
         in the Renaissance and then reformulated in the 17th century, particularly 
         during the early development of classical mechanics. In Isaac Newton's view,
          space was absolute—in the sense that it existed permanently and independently
           of whether there was any matter in the space.
